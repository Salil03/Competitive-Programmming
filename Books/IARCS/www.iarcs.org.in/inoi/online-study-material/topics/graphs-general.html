      <h3><span>From grids to graphs</span></h3>

      <p>
	Suppose the director shifts his shooting location to a venue where
	buildings are no longer arranged in a nice rectangular grid.
      </p>

      <p>
	Assume we have N buildings 1,2,...,N and a list of pairs
	{(i1,j1), (i2,j2), ..., (iM,jM)} where each pair (i,j)
	says that building i and building j are "neighbours" ---
	that is, they are near enough in distance and height for
	the hero to jump from i to j or j to i.  The hero has to
	start at building 1 and the captive is in building N.
      </p>

      <p>
	For instance, suppose we have 7 buildings 1,2,...,7 and
	the list of neighbours are given by
      </p>

      <p align="center">
       {(1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(3,4),(5,6),(7,6),(5,7}.
      </p>

      <p>
	Can the hero rescue the captive?
      </p>

      <p>
	No, because there is no way to go from the set of
	buildings {1,2,3,4} to the set of buildings {5,6,7}.
      </p>

      <p>
	If we draw this as a picture, it is easy to see that this problem has no
	solution:
      </p>

      <pre>
                   2
                 /   \
               /       \
             1 --------- 3 --------  4


             5 --------- 6
               \       /
                 \   /
                   7

      </pre>

      <p>
	Here, each building is labelled and we draw a line from i
	to j if i and j are neighbours.  From the picture, it is
	immediate that there is no way to travel from {1,2,3,4}
	to {5,6,7}.
      </p>

      <p>
	This kind of picture is called a graph.  A graph is a pair G = (V,E) where
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  V is a set of vertices (or nodes) In our example, these
	  represent the buildings.
	</li>

	<li>
	  E is a set of pairs of positions, called edges. In our
          example, these represent the pairs of buildings that
          are neighbours.
	</li>
	
      </ul>

      <p>
	How do we check reachability in this framework?  We can
	use a queue as before:
      </p>

      <ul>

	<li>
	  Mark starting position 1 and start with queue {1}.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Unmarked neighbours of 1 are {2,3}, so mark {2,3} and
	  update queue to {2,3}.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Neighbours of 2 are {1,2} but both are already marked,
	  so do nothing and update queue to {3}.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Unmarked neighbour of 3 is {4} so mark 4 and update
	  queue to {4}.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Neighbour of 4 is {3} that is already marked, so do
	  nothing and update queue to {}.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Queue is empty, so stop.  Marked nodes are {1,2,3,4}
	  which are precisely the nodes reachable from 1.
	</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
	Notice that we have used exactly the same algorithm as we
	did for the rectangular grid.  The only difference is
	that instead of implicitly identifying neighbours with
	respect to grid positions, we are explicitly given the
	neighbours for each node.
      </p>

      <h3><span>Graphs, basic definitions</span></h3>

      <div id="graphs-basics">
	<p>
	  A graph is given by a pair G = (V,E), were V is the set
          of vertices E is the set of edges.  Each edge e in E
          connects a pair of vertices (v,v'), so E is a subset of
          V&times;V, where V&times;V denotes the set set of all
          pairs of vertices.  We normally assume that there are
          no self loops: that is, no edges of the form (v,v).
	</p>

	<p>
	  By convention, N or n = |V| = number of vertices, M or m = |E| =
	  number of edges.    
	</p>

      </div>

      <div id="graphs=degree">
	<p>
	  The <em>degree</em> of a vertex v is the number of
	  edges with v as one end point.  The sum of the degrees
	  of all the vertices in a graph is even.  Each edge adds
	  1 to the degree of the vertex at both end points.
	  Thus,
	</p>

	<pre>
              sum    degree(v) = 2 |E| = 2m
             v in V
        </pre>

      </div>

      <div id="graphs-path">

	<p>
	  A <em>path</em> is a sequence v_1 v_2 &hellip; v_k of
	  distinct vertices such that each adjacent pair v_i
	  v_i+1 is an edge.  (Note: a path cannot visit the same
	  vertex twice.  If a vertex is visited more than once in
	  such a sequence, it is called a <em>walk</em>, not a
	  path.)
	</p>

      </div>

      <div id="graphs-cycle">
	<p>
	  A <em>cycle</em> is a sequence of vertices v_1 v_2
	  ... v_k v_1, where v_1 v_2 ... v_k is a path and v_k
	  v_1 is an edge.  (i.e. a cycle is a path that is closed
	  by an edge from the last vertex in the path back to the
	  initial vertex.)
	</p>
      </div>
      
      <div id="graphs-connectedness">
	<p>Nodes u and v are <em>connected</em> if there is a
	  path from u to v.  A graph is connected if every pair
	  of nodes is connected.
	</p>

	<p>
	  How do we check if a graph is connected?
	  An undirected graph is connected precisely when depth
	  first search or breadth first search marks
	  all vertices (you can choose any start vertex v).
	</p>
      </div>

      <div id="graphs-tree">
	<p>A <em>tree</em> is connected graph without cycles.</p>

	<pre>
                      o-----o
                     / \
            o-------o   o-------o
                   /    |\

	</pre>

	<p>
	  A tree as a minimal connected graph.  By induction, we
	  can show that a tree on n vertices always has exactly
	  n-1 edges. In any tree, there is a unique path between
	  any pair of vertices.
	</p>

      </div>

      <div id="graphs-weighted-graph">
	<p>
	  If we attach a cost with each edge we get
	  a <em>weighted graph</em>.  The cost could represent
	  distance, or time, or some other natural quantity
	  associated with traversing the edge.
