      <h3><span>Solving finite games</span></h3>

      <p>
        The bottom up computation in
        the <a href="games-bead-necklace.html">Bead Necklace</a>
        game corresponds to the following top down analysis,
        which applies for any game that has a finite number of
        positions.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two players 0 and 1.  The game is described as
        a game graph.  The vertices are the positions and each
        position of the game is labelled 0 or 1 depending on
        which player moves at that position.  The edges describe
        how the game can evolve from one position to another.
      </p>

      <p>
        We label some of the positions as winning for player 0
        &mdash; let this set be G.  If the game ever reached G,
        player 0 wins.  Otherwise, player 1 wins.  (If the game
        graph is a dag, all plays will end in a sink state, so we
        just label the sink states as winning for 0/1, as in the
        Pearls game.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Let W0 denote the set of positions from which player 0 can win in at most n
        moves.  W0 is G, since, if the game is in a position in G, player 0 has
        already won.
      </p>

      <p>
        We now calculate W1.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> Consider any state s labelled 0 from which there is
          at least outgoing edge to t in W.  Then, 0 can move
          into W = W0 and win, so s belongs to W1. </li>

        <li> Symmetrically, consider any state s labelled 1 from
          which all outgoing edges lead to W.  Then, 1 is forced
          to move into W = W0 where 0 wins, so t belongs to
          W1. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In general, let Wi be the set of positions from where
        player 0 is guaranteed to win in i moves.  We can
        calculate W{i+1}.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> Consider any state s labelled 0 from which there is
          at least outgoing edge to t in Wi.  Then, 0 can move
          into Wi and win in i moves, so s belongs to
          W{i+1}. </li>

        <li> Symmetrically, consider any state s labelled 1 from
          which all outgoing edges lead to some Wj, for j &le; i.
          Then, 1 is forced to move into Wj from where 0 wins in
          j moves, so t belongs to W{i+1}. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Notice that W0 is included in W1 is included in W2 ...
        Since the game graph has only n positions, for some i, we
        must have Wi = W{i+1}.  In particular, we must stop when
        we reach W{n-1} because we cannot add more than n-1 new
        nodes to the original set W0.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let W the final winning set for 0 &mdash; that is, W = Wi
        such that Wi = W{i+1}.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Claim:</b>
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li> If the game starts in W, player 0 always wins. </li>
        <li> If the game starts outside W, player 1 always wins. </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <b>Proof:</b> 
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li> If the game starts in W, player 1 cannot move the
          game outside W.  Player 0 can not only stay in W but
          also "decrease the rank" &mdash; that is, move from Wi
          to W{i-1}.  So, after some time, the game must reach W0
          where player 0 wins. </li>

        <li> On the other hand, if the game starts outside W,
          player 0 cannot move the game to within W and player 1
          can always keep the game outside W.  Since player 0 can
          never reach G, player 1 must win. </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        How do we compute these quantities?
      </p>

      <p>
        Naively, this can be done in O(nm) time &mdash; we have
        to compute sets W1,...,X{n-1} and we scan all edges in
        each iteration.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, with some care, we can do it in O(m) time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Hint:</b> Keep a count at each neighbour of how many
        good neighbours it has.  Initialize this count to 0.
        When you add a node to W, notify all your incoming
        neighbours that you are good (increment their good
        neighbour count).
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li> To classify a 0 vertex as good, check if its good
          count is nonzero. </li>

        <li> To classify a 1 vertex as good, check if its good
          count is equal to its degree. </li>

      </ul>
      
      <p> 
        This can be done in linear time, like BFS.
      </p>
