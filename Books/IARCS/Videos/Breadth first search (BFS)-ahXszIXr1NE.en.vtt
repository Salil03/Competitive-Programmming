00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.500
So, let us look at a formal algorithm to explore
a graph. So, recall that a graph consists

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.130
of a set of vertices and a set of edges, the
edges are the connections between the vertices,

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.410
they may be directed or undirected.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.900
So, if we look at undirected graph, the problem
we are looking at is to find out, whether

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.609
a source vertex is connected to a target vertex.
And we said that this amounts to finding a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:32.070
path from v 0 the source vertex to v k the
target vertex, where each pair of vertices

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.480
on the path is connected by an edge in the
graph.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.180
So, we argued that we could easily do this
for small graphs visually, but if you want

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.650
to write an algorithm, we need a way of representing
the graph. So, the first thing we decided

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.060
was, that we would name the vertices 1 to
n. So, we have n vertices, we will just call

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.890
them 1, 2, 3, 4 up to n. Then we can represent
the structure of the graph through an adjacency

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.350
matrix.
In this adjacency matrix, the i j’th entry

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.329
indicates the presence or absence of an edge
from vertex i to vertex j. So, a i j is 1,

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:12.259
there is an edge, a i j is 0, if there is
no edge. In this matrix, if you want to find

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.109
out, whether pair of vertices are directly
connecting, we just have to probe the appropriate

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:21.630
entry, we can do that in constant time. To
find all the outgoing neighbors of a vertex,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.170
we have to scan the row for that vertex. So,
that takes linear time in terms of the number

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.409
of vertices. Now, one thing we observed is
that, typically in many graphs, this matrix

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.450
is largely 0, most pairs are not connected.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.890
So, we can get a more compact representation
by just listing out the neighbors of each

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.520
vertex. So, instead of keeping a row of 1’s
and 0’s, we just record those vertices,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.619
whose entries are 1. So, this gives us a more
efficient representation for graphs, where

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.280
the number of edges is closer to the number
of vertices. But, in this case in order to

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.770
find out, whether a given pair i j is connected,
we have to look at the list for i and see,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.170
if j appears in it.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.110
Now, our strategy for finding a path connecting
a source vertex and a target vertex, goes

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.780
as follows, we would start at the source vertex
and keep exploring the graph systematically.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.190
Each time, we went to a vertex, we would mark
it as visited, and then we have to make sure,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.870
that when we were exploring vertices, we did
not re-explore the same vertex twice. So,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.200
we said there would be two fundamental strategies
breadth first and depth first. So, today we

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.550
are going to look at breadth first search.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.780
So, the idea of breadth first search is to
explore the graph level by level. So, we start

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.020
at the source vertex and we now explore all
the vertices, which are one step away, connected

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.400
by a direct edge to the source vertex. Then,
we look at all vertices which are newly connected

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.180
one step away from level 1 vertices. So, these
are two steps away from the source vertex,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.650
then for three steps and so on.
Now, while we are doing this exploration,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.670
we have to keep track of two quantities, we
have to first note of course, whether a given

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.180
vertex has been visited. Has it been explored,
is it connected to the source vertex, also

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.590
for each such vertex, we have to explore its
neighbors. So, for each vertex, we need to

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.460
know, a, has it been visited and we may not
be able to explore it as soon as it is visited.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.980
So, we need to remember that we have explored
it or not explored it and those which are

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.990
not explored, we have to make sure we explore
them once.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.270
So, the way to do this is to use some data
structures to keep track of these quantities.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.850
As we said the set of vertices is numbered
1 to n. So, we can keep an array visited with

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.430
entries 1 to n, which tells us whether or
not vertex i has been visited. Now, whenever

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.540
we visit a vertex, we need to subsequently
explore it. Since, we may not explore it immediately,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.160
we may have to keep it pending for a while.
So, we have to keep a collection of these

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.840
vertices, which have been visited, but not
yet been explored.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.050
There are many ways to do this, but one natural
way is to explore them in the order in which

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.900
they were visited. So, if we want to explore
in the order in which they were visited, a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.680
natural data structure to keep the list of
unexplored, but visited vertices is a queue.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.879
So, we put each visited vertex into the queue,
the first time we come to it, and then we

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:28.870
process all the vertices in the queue, until
all vertices have been explored.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.430
So, here is some high level Pseudo code for
breadth first search, when we reach a vertex

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.030
i which we have visited for the first time,
we will eventually explore it. What does it

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.599
mean to explore a vertex, we look at the outgoing
edges i comma j, if j has already been visited,

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:50.860
we are nothing to do. On the other hand, if
j has not been visited, then we will mark

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.160
it as visited and add it to the queue to be
explore later.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.870
So, we begin by marking the source vertex
and adding it to the queue and at each stage,

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.389
we will explore the vertex at the head of
the queue. If at some stage, there are no

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.330
vertices in the queue, it means that every
vertex, we have visited has been explored

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.341
and so there is no new information left and
we can stop the exploration.

00:05:14.341 --> 00:05:19.120
So, before giving the actual code for breadth
first search, let us workout the example that

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.900
we have and see, how these data structures
are updated. So, we have these 10 vertices

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:31.570
1 to 10 and we are looking for paths starting
at 1. So, in the queue, we have two pointers

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.969
as usual, we have a pointer which we indicate
in green, which is the head of the queue,

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.889
and a pointer red, which is the tail of the
queue.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:45.229
So, we initialize the queue to have the starting
vertex 1 and we also mark this vertex has

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:53.719
been visited. Now, we have to explore 1, so
what we do is we remove 1 from the queue and

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:58.930
systematically check each of its outgoing
edges and if those target vertices are not

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:05.580
already visited, we add that. So, 2 is the
first in order of 1 to 10, first neighbor

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.569
of 1, it has not been visited, so we add it
to the queue and mark 2 as visited in the

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:14.190
visited array.
Likewise, we mark 3 as visited, and then we

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.199
mark 4 as visited, at this stage, we have
finished exploring vertex 1. So, now, we go

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.819
back to the queue and see, if there is anything
yet to be explore, which have been visited

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:29.259
and there is we pick up the first such namely
2. So, I remove 2 from the queue and we explore

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:34.270
its outgoing neighbors. Now, the outgoing
neighbors of 2 in this case are 1 and 3. But,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.530
since 1 and 3 are both visited, we have no
work to do and we go on and go back to the

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.069
queue.
So in the next stage, we pick up the vertex

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:48.600
3 and we look at its outgoing neighbors. Again,
it has outgoing neighbors 1 and 2, both of

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.919
which are already visited, so there is nothing
to be done. We come back to the queue and

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:59.229
pickup 4 and try to explore it. So, 4 has
a neighbor 1, which has already been visited,

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:06.199
the next neighbor is 5, since 5 is new we
added to the queue and we mark it as visited,

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:12.120
then it has a neighbor 8. So, we add that
also to the queue and mark it as visited.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.439
Now, we have finished exploring 4. So, we
go back to the queue and look for the next

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:25.789
thing to be explored, which in this case is
5. So, 5 has got neighbors 4, 6 and 7; 4 has

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:35.189
already been visited, but 6 is new and so
is 7. Now, we go back and explore 8, so 8

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:44.110
has neighbors 4, 6 and 9; 4 and 6 are old,
but 9 is new, we add 9 to the queue. Now,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.999
we go back and explore 6, because 6 is the
vertex at the head of the queue.

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:53.949
So, now, we look at neighbors of 6, neighbors
of 6 are 5, 7, 8 and 9. So, when we remove

00:07:53.949 --> 00:08:01.069
6 from the queue, we have nothing to do, we
go back and find that, there is nothing to

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:06.210
be done, because all the neighbors of 6 have
already been visited. Then, we pick up 7;

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.339
once again we find that all the neighbors
of 7 have already been visited. Finally, we

00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:18.749
pickup 9 and when we pickup 9, we find that
it has neighbors 6, 8 and 10, 10 is new, so

00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:23.339
10 gets marked and added to the queue.
Finally, we go to 10, we find it has only

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:27.490
one neighbor 9, which is already visited,
at this stage the queue becomes empty and

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:32.159
the algorithm terminates. Now, in this case,
we have marked all the vertices as visited,

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:37.159
which indicates that every vertex in this
graph is actually reachable from 1. If we

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:41.529
had had more vertices, for example, if we
had add a component in this graph; that is

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:46.940
nothing to stop us from having many components
we could have a graph with more vertices 11,

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:52.850
12, 13 and 14. Then this process starting
from 1 would have left 11, 12, 13 and 14 marked

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.670
as unvisited.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:04.160
So, here is some more formal code for BFS,
so BFS is a function which takes as it is

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.010
argument, the vertex from where we want to
explore the graph. So, as we said the vertices

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:15.680
are called 1 to n, we have this array visited,
which is initialized to 0 and we have a queue

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.649
to mark the vertices still to be explored,
this is initialized to empty. So, we begin

00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:28.860
by marking that visited of i equal to 1. So,
vertex i is marked as visited and we added

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.170
to the queue.
Now, so long as the queue is not empty, we

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:37.060
proceed in the following loop, we extract
the head of the queue, the vertex to be explored

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:43.029
next. For each of its outgoing edges, if it
is something which has not been visited before,

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:48.010
we mark it as visited and we add it to the
queue. So, this is exactly the code for the

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:52.279
algorithm, we just executed by hand and it
is quiet straight forward. There are two data

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:56.930
structures, an array to keep track of the
visited vertices and a queue to keep track

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.470
of vertices which need to be explored further.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:06.990
So, how do we analyze the complexity of an
algorithm such as this. One way to do it is

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.130
to look at the loop. So, remember that, when
we have an algorithm like this which has a

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.940
loop, the loop is usually the place where
we have to look for it. So, we have one iteration,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:21.230
where we have a loop of 1 to n; where we assign,
visited j equal to 0. So, this is something

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:26.449
which takes order n time.
And now, we have a loop here, where we keep

00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:32.210
extracting things from the queue and we do
things here. So, we have to kind of understand,

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:37.240
how many times this loop is going to execute
and how much time this inner loop is going

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:44.190
to execute. So, each vertex enters the queue
exactly once. So, if it enters at exactly

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:52.089
once, then it says that this outer loop here
will take order n time.

00:10:52.089 --> 00:10:57.100
Because, assuming the graph is connected,
every vertex will be visited once and when

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.779
that vertex is visited it will enter the queue
and it will come out from the head of the

00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:07.500
queue exactly once. Now, for each vertex,
we have to scan all its neighbors. So, what

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:14.380
we said was that, this will be order n, if
we have an adjacency matrix. Because we need

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:22.269
to go from the first entry for j and we have
to look at the entire row for j, so this is

00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:24.940
order n.
So, therefore, the graph is connected first

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:30.069
of all every vertex will get into the queue.
So, we will do the queue loop exactly n times.

00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:34.290
And for each j that is extracted, we need
to examine all its neighbors. So, that will

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:41.600
be a scan of size n and therefore, overall
it is order n square, this two nested loops

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.980
of size n.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.860
So, this is clearly a situation, where if
we have very few edges, we can improve the

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:53.310
complexity by using an adjacency list representation
instead of an adjacency matrix representation.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:12:01.480
So, the number of edges is m and m is much
smaller than n squared. So, if m is say proportional

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:08.971
to n itself, then what we can do is in the
list associated with j, which just have to

00:12:08.971 --> 00:12:13.190
look at the neighbors of j. We do not have
to look at all the vertices all of order n

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.590
entries in the adjacency matrix, this is called
the degree.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:25.170
So, the degree of a vertex is the number of
vertices connected to it. So, if we do this,

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:30.860
then what we will find is that, inside the
iteration of the inner loop, each step of

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:36.670
scanning for the neighbors takes time proportional
degree of j. Now, the degree of j of course,

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.790
varies from one node to another, so how do
we count this correctly. So, if you do not

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:48.389
count it per loop, but count it across the
entire processing of the entire set of vertices,

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:54.820
what we will see is that for every edge in
the graph, of the form i comma j.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:00.829
There will be a time and i is process and
I will see j in this list and there will be

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:06.709
a time and j is processed and I will see i
in this list. In other words, if I take all

00:13:06.709 --> 00:13:12.120
the adjacency lists of all the vertices, each
edge will be represented twice and an edge

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:17.540
i j will appear as an entry j in the list
for i and an entry i in the list for j. So,

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:24.449
while, it is not easy to count per iteration,
I count across all iterations, I will explore

00:13:24.449 --> 00:13:29.490
each edge exactly twice.
So, 2 m is order m, so overall exploring the

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:36.190
neighbors across all n iteration takes time
O m. So, what this means is that, the first

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:44.569
iteration of visiting the marking everything
visited takes time O m, when we have a O n

00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:50.720
loop, across which we do O m steps totally
across the n steps, so it is overall n plus

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.250
m. So, the complexity of the breadth first
search, if you are using an adjacency list,

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:03.589
it drops to O n plus m versus order n squared
for the adjacency matrix. So, if we have fewer

00:14:03.589 --> 00:14:09.529
edges then it makes a lot of sense to use
adjacency list for breadth first search.

00:14:09.529 --> 00:14:18.000
Now, in graphs the input size is typically
taken to the m and n. In other words, both

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.161
parameters are somewhat independent of each
other; because we could have the set of vertices

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:25.680
with very few edges with very many edges.
So, usually m and n together are taken to

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:33.790
be the input size. So, order m plus n is actually
a linear algorithm. So, this is the best possible,

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.485
because we have to read the input in order
to process it typically. So, in linear time,

00:14:36.485 --> 00:14:40.250
we are able to do breadth first search.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:48.020
So, we can do something more in breadth first
search, all we have identified is which vertices

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.689
are connected to the initial vertex one or
the source vertex in general from where you

00:14:52.689 --> 00:14:58.100
start breadth first search. So, how do we
identify, how to go from the source vertex

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:04.460
to a given vertex. So, if we start at i and
BFS i sets visited j equal to 1, we know that

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.800
i and j are connected, but we do not know
the path.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:14.660
So, what we can easily do is to remember,
where we marked each vertex from. So, when

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:20.160
we mark a vertex k as visited, it is marked
because it is a neighbor of some already visited

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:27.810
neighbor j. So, then we can say that k was
marked by j, we will use the word parent.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:34.519
So, we will say that the parent of k is j,
then by following the parent links; we can

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:38.560
re-construct the path backwards from k to
the original source vertex.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:46.949
So, this is very easy to do our code, so we
just have to add one line, or two lines. So,

00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:51.880
initially we say that for every vertex the
parent is undefined. So, we might set the

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:57.300
value like minus 1, because we note that the
name of vertices are 1 to n, and then when

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:04.399
we mark a vertex, since we are exploring an
edge j k, the parent of k is going to be j.

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:08.249
So, we assign the parent of k equal to j,
the rest of the code is identical to the earlier

00:16:08.249 --> 00:16:13.999
breadth first search, we just added this new
array parent to keep track of how we mark

00:16:13.999 --> 00:16:17.480
the vertices. So, that we can re-constructs
the path.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:23.589
So, we can go backward, so because k was mark
by j, j would be mark by some other thing

00:16:23.589 --> 00:16:28.910
and so on. So, by just following these links
back, we can go back from any k to the start

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:36.040
vertex and therefore, we can reconstruct the
path. The other thing that we can do in breadth

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.259
first search is keep track of the level. So,
remember, we said that breadth first search

00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:44.040
actually explores the graph level by level.
Looks at all the vertices which are one step

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.069
away from the source, then those vertices
that are one step away from these ones, so

00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:52.220
they are at level 2, two steps away from the
source and so on. So, instead of just saying

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:58.470
that a vertex is visited, we can ask at what
level it was visit. So, initially we say that

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:03.709
all the levels are undefined, and then each
time we visit a new vertex, it is 1 level

00:17:03.709 --> 00:17:09.150
more than the vertex from which it was visit.
So, eventually we say that, if level j is

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:14.589
assign some number p, it must be p steps away
from the original vertex.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:20.130
So, this can also be easily added to our code
along with the parent code. So, last time,

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:29.100
we added this assignment for the parent. Now,
we also add the assignment for level, so we

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:34.820
say initially the level of each vertex is
undefined. So, it is some nonsensical value

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:42.480
like minus 1. Then, we say that the level
of the start vertex is 0, and now whenever

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:48.419
we visit a new vertex, if it is level, if
it is visited, then it must have a level.

00:17:48.419 --> 00:17:55.570
So, if this level is minus 1, so its level
is minus 1, it means it is not visit, so level

00:17:55.570 --> 00:18:10.560
minus 1 means not visited. Same as in our
earlier thing, same as visited k is 0 and

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.220
if so we adjust the level of k to be one more
than the level of j from which it was visited

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.300
and of course, we set the parent as before.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:23.630
So, we can see all this works in our earlier
example, as usual we start with 1 and we mark

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:29.180
its level as 0 and it does not have a parent.
Now, when we add 2, 3 and 4 all of them will

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:34.130
be at level 1 and all of them will have as
parent 1, because they all were explore from

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:42.169
1. Then, as before 2 does not add anything
new to our list, 3 does not add anything new

00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:47.370
to our list.
Now, 4 will add 5 and 8, so for these 2, the

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:53.409
level will be 2 and the parent will be 4,
indicating that I got to 5 and 8 from 4 in

00:18:53.409 --> 00:19:00.160
my exploration. Then, from 5, I will get 6
and 7. So, these are now at level 3, because

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:05.700
5 was itself at level 2, therefore, 6 and
7 are at level 3 and their parents are 5,

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:12.480
from 8, I will go to 9, so 9 is also at level
3, because 8 was already at level 2, so 9

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:18.440
is level 3 and its parent is 8.
And finally, we will find that 10 is at level

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:25.450
4 and its parent is 9. So, now, we can trace
back. So, we can say that, I got from 10,

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:33.210
I came from 9, so 9 came from 8, so 8 came
from 4, 4 came from 1. So, the path is actually

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:44.620
10 to 9 to 8 to 4 to 1 and you can see indeed,
we have a path from 10 to 9 to 8 to 4 to 1.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:52.100
So, this is how you can reconstruct the path
information and also the distance information

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:58.030
at the same time, when you are computing breadth
first search.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:02.929
So, breadth first search if we add this level
predicate, it actually gives us the shortest

00:20:02.929 --> 00:20:08.950
path to each node in terms of number of edges.
Now, in general, we will see that, if you

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:14.149
do not have a uniform cost, if we have different
costs on edges, then the shortest path need

00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:18.610
not be just the shortest in terms of number
of edges. We have to add the cost associated

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:23.400
with each path these are called weighted graphs.
But, in an unweighted graph that is a graph

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:28.450
which just has simple edges the way we have
it now. Breadth first search has the added

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:33.429
advantage of computing the shortest path in
terms of number of edges from the source vertex

00:20:33.429 --> 00:20:34.570
to every reachable vertex from it.
